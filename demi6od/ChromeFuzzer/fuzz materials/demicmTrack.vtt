00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What is your post (job position)?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
My business card contains all activities I do.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It is very uncomfortable to have several types. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This one contains web pages of my businesses and non-commercial activities -

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.000
my personal web page with books I have written, web page for consulting and couching, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
E-zeny project with my friend and my key business - Tricio, a travel agency I have run since 1996.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
How did it come that you have this job? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It is unbelievable but long time ago, 17 years ago, I had a dream. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We were expecting our second child and I realized that I could not travel the same way with two children.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We were travelling along Slovakia back then

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and I used to have trouble with preparing food for a child in a hotel.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
With the second child in my belly 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I said to myself how wonderful it would be to rent chalets or cottages near forest or lake.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Then I searched for travel agencies with such portfolio. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I found few but they did not have what I had wanted.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The idea was swirling in my head. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
My subconscious mind must have been working hard 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because I woke up one day with an exact marketing plan. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I waited impatiently for my husband to wake up and to tell him about my perfect business plan. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We will have one thousand chalets for rent,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
one thousand crowns for one rental which will earn us one million.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
He woke up, looked at me in surprise and fell asleep again. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But I was not able to resist the idea. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Internet was an unknown idea, at least in Slovakia at that time. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, I was collecting information about travel industry, about Slovakia from various magazines.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
With my belly growing bigger, 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I filed an application for travel agent license which was, by the way, very hard to receive. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Describe your working day - what is your daily routine?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I do reading and writing in the mornings   

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I read texts from people I help with writing or I write my texts.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I do managerial work in Tricio from midday   

00:03:41.000 --> 00:04:00.000
distribution of tasks for my team, or some consulting or couching plus some meetings   all until 4 or 5 p.m. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Or, I do E-zeny in the afternoon   

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is a project supporting women in internet business that I do with my friend Monika Jakubecovï¿½. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We organize seminars and workshops for them in the afternoon   

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Breakfast with E-zeny or Inspiring meetings with E-zeny. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Well, this is my usual working day.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Is it the career (job) that you imagined foe yourself?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When I was a young girl, I dreamed to have an editorial office with piles of paper everywhere. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:17.000
When I recall it now and compare with what I have now, 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000
it is almost exactly what I imagined.  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And, when I sometimes realize that I have departed from what I imagined I redirect what I do. 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I start to write about a person who has got what I do not have and that makes me feel free again.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
How would it be without this job? 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:10.000
There was a time when I planned to sell my travel agency and do only writing, couching or consultancy.  

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But thinking about it harder, I felt I would sell my soul. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I worked very hard to build the travel business

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and now I want to sell it to somebody 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:40.000
who may not be able to do it with same effort and enthusiasm. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:56.000
When the day came to sell the business I cried hard and decided not to sell it. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I recall that day every time I have doubts about what is right or wrong.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Which limitations does this work have?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Well, we can see it from different angle. 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It is not a restriction. 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
When you are an entrepreneur   

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
there are cycles in business and sometimes you need to kick up your business.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
firm needs you, not your fear.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Fear is a restriction. 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You must think positively to be successful. 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It can be a restriction that a person from different environment,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:16.000
a couch or a fellow entrepreneur can support.  

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I have my personal couch, too. 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Please give young people (pupils, students)
three pieces of advice

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I often see people pushing a business plan that other people believe is good. 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
People should listen to their hearts and not limit their dreams to earning money.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It is perfect to combine doing what you like and earning money from such activity. 

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You can look at many occupations from a different angle. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:12.000
An insurance agent once told me that he hated selling insurance policies to people. 

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Then, he changed the angle and realized that his job was listening to stories of different people. 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
He found the good in his job. 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It is similar for me. 

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I have never dreamed about combining writing and travelling. 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Now, I run my own company Tricio.
